        The advent of the Covid-19 global pandemic brought about in its wake an aftermath of untold anguish, anxiety, deaths, downsizing of well to do firms and businesses, together with unprecedented job redundancies as most of the said business organizations vehemently struggled to stay afloat.
        One of the adverse effects of the nefarious pandemic is that untold numbers lost their respective jobs and some businesses went under, consequently multitudes of previously working classes were rendered jobless and were desperate to survive. Even affording to put a single meal on the table became a daunting task.
        Due to job shortages and businesses struggling to  survive, many found themselves doing what they would ever do, which is prostitution or better put commercial sex in order to earn a living 
        Even though this type of “Commercial” economic activity had never previously crossed the minds of these fine ladies, they were left with no other viable option other than to engage in commercial sex working in a very desperate attempt to make ends meet and provide basic needs for themselves and for their beloved children.
        The resultant effect of this, is that there was an overwhelming numbers of commercial sex workers that were simply pushed into it due to the prevailing tough economic situation that issued from the Covid-19 Pandemic.
        Many if not multitudes of these commercial sex workers were formerly very decent ladies that if given an alternative that would economically sustain them, they would be more than glad to abandon this illicit indiginifying trade.
